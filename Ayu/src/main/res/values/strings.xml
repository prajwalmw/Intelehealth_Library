    <string name="privacy_policy_content">Your privacy is important to us. Intelehealth’s Enterprise
        Privacy Policy aligns with Generally Accepted
        Privacy Principles (GAPP). The GAPP are founded on key concepts from significant
        national and international privacy laws, regulations and good business practices.\n\n
In case of any privacy related complaints/grievances, please fill and submit this Privacy
        Complaint Form to privacy@intelehealth.io\n\n<font color='#201560' size='16'><b>Introduction</b></font>\n\nIntelehealth endeavours to meet leading standards for data protection and privacy.
        While our reasons are founded in ethical and corporate responsibility,
        our privacy practices as outlined in this policy enable the following:

\n\n<li>Dignity for patients: Our work bringing primary healthcare to underserved communities
        in developing countries and humanitarian conflict zones means we must be mindful
        of upholding a standard of ethical caring, including patient privacy.</li>\n

<li>Competitive Advantage: Our emphasis on protecting the privacy of customers, vendors,
    and employees distinguishes us from competitors.</li>\n

<li>Good Corporate Citizenship: A sound privacy policy is emblematic of reliable corporate citizens that
    respect individuals’ privacy.</li>\n

<li>Business Enablement: Since Intelehealth uses significant volumes of personal information,
    privacy notices are a prerequisite to building enduring business relationships.</li>\n

<li>Legal Protection: Appropriate privacy notices offer an opportunity to eliminate allegations of
        unlawful usage of personal information, to limit liability for the conduct of third-party
    associates and to reserve the right to amend the Enterprise Privacy Policy.</li>\n
        <font color='#201560' size='16'><b>\nPurpose\n\n</b></font>This Policy defines requirements to ensure compliance with laws and regulations applicable to
        Intelehealth’s collection, use, and transmission of Personal Data.\n\n

   <font color='#201560' size='16'><b>\Scope\n\n</b></font>This policy is applicable to all Intelehealth employees, joint venture employees, contractors,
        vendors, interns, customers, end users and business partners who, as part of valid
        business operations, may receive personal information from Intelehealth, have access
        to personal information collected or processed by Intelehealth, or who provide information to Intelehealth.

\nThis policy covers the treatment of personal information gathered and used by Intelehealth for
        lawful business purposes. This policy also covers the personal information we share with
        authorized Third Parties or that Third Parties share with us.

\n“Personal information” refers to any information, whether recorded in a material form or not,
        from which the identity of an individual is apparent or can be reasonably and directly
        ascertained by the entity holding the information, or when put together with other information
        would directly and certainly identify an individual.

\nSensitive personal information refers to personal information:

\n\n<li>About an individual’s race, ethnic origin, colour, caste or tribal affiliation, marital status,
            age, and religious, philosophical or political affiliations;</li>

\n\n<li>About an individual’s health, education, genetic or sexual life of a person, or to any proceeding for any
        offense committed or alleged to have been committed by such individual, the disposal of such proceedings,
            or the sentence of any court in such proceedings;</li>

\n\n<li>Issued by government agencies peculiar to an individual which includes, but is not limited to, social
        security numbers, aadhar numbers, previous or current health records, licenses or its denials,
        suspension or revocation, and tax returns;</li>

\n\nSpecial categories of personal data, where Intelehealth operations are within the scope of European
        Union regulations or equivalent protections, are:

\n\n<li>Personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
            beliefs, or trade union membership</li>

        \n\n<li>Genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person</li>

\n\n<li>Data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.</li>

<font color='#201560' size='16'><b>\n\nExceptions\n\n</b></font>This policy does not apply to the privacy practices of third parties whose operations we do not own or
        control, including but not limited to any third-party services facilitated by Intelehealth, or
        to any individuals we do not manage or employ, unless otherwise contractually agreed upon between
        the third party and Intelehealth.

<font color='#201560' size='16'><b>\n\nObjective\n\n</b></font>
The main objectives of the Enterprise Privacy Policy are:\n

\n<li>To ensure that all of the personal data or personal information in Intelehealth’s custody is adequately
            protected against threats to maintain its security.</li>

\n\n<li>To ensure that Intelehealth’s employees &amp; contractors are fully aware of the contractual, statutory or
            regulatory implications of any privacy breaches.</li>

        \n\n<li>To limit the use of personal data or personal information to identified business purposes for which it is collected.</li>

\n\n<li>To create an awareness of privacy requirements to be an integral part of the day to day operation of every
        employee &amp; contractor and ensure that all employees &amp; contractors understand the importance
            of privacy practices and their responsibilities for maintaining privacy.</li>

\n\n<li>To make all the employees &amp; contractors aware about the processes that need to be followed for collection,
            lawful usage, disclosure/ transfer and disposal of personal data or personal information.</li>

\n\n<li>To ensure that all third parties storing and processing personal information on behalf of Intelehealth provide
            adequate data protection.</li>

\n\n<li>To ensure that all applicable regulations and contracts regarding the maintenance of privacy and protection
            of personal data or personal information are adhered to.</li>

<font color='#201560' size='16'><b>\n\nPolicy</b></font>
<font color='#EA315B' size='14'><b>\nMANAGEMENT</b></font>\nDevelop and maintain an Enterprise Privacy Policy that documents the privacy principles and practices
        followed by Intelehealth.

The Enterprise Privacy Policy shall be communicated to Intelehealth’s internal personnel and any external
        personnel required to comply with the policy.

Establish procedures for disciplinary and remedial action for violations of the Enterprise Privacy Policy.
        Refer Annexure D: Disciplinary guidelines

Changes or updates to the Enterprise Privacy shall be communicated to Intelehealth’s internal personnel
        when the changes become effective.

A Privacy Request procedure shall be defined to process complaints and requests for information related to
        Intelehealth’s privacy practices. Refer Annexure E.

<font color='#EA315B' size='14'><b>\n\nNOTICE</b></font>
\nAppropriate notice shall be provided at the time an individual is asked to give consent to the collection
        or processing of personal information and whenever personal information is collected.

        \n<ol>The Privacy Notice shall provide the following information:

            <li>\nPurposes for which personal information is collected, used and disclosed;</li>

<li>\nChoices available to the individual regarding collection, use and disclosure of
        personal information;</li>

        <li>\nThat personal information shall only be collected for the identified purposes;</li>

<li>\nMethods employed for collection of personal information, including ‘cookies’ and other tracking techniques,
    and third party agencies;</li>

<li>\nThat an individual’s personal information shall be disclosed to Third Parties only for identified lawful
    business purposes and with the consent of the individual;</li>

<li>\nThat an individual’s personal information may be transferred within Intelehealth’s
    entities for business purposes;</li>

<li>\nConsequences of withholding or withdrawing consent to the collection, use and disclosure of personal information
    for identified purposes;</li>

<li>\nIndividuals are responsible for providing Intelehealth with accurate and complete personal information, and for
    contacting the entity if correction of such information is required;</li>

        <li>\nProcess for an individual to access and update their personal information records;</li>

<li>\nProcess for an individual to register a complaint or grievance regarding privacy
    practices at Intelehealth;</li>

<li>\nProcess for an individual to withdraw consent for the collection, use and disclosure of their personal information for
    identified purposes; and</li>

<li>\nThat implicit or explicit consent is required to collect, use and disclose personal information, unless a law or regulation
        specifically requires or allows otherwise.</li></ol>

\n\n<li>Individuals shall be provided a Privacy Notice in case any new purpose is identified for using or disclosing personal
            information before such information is used for purposes not previously identified.</li>

        \n\n<li>The Notice shall be in language that is simple and easy to understand, especially for marginalized communities.</li>

<font color='#EA315B' size='14'><b>\n\nCHOICE AND CONSENT</b></font>
\nImplicit or explicit consent shall be obtained from individuals at the time of collection of personal information or as
        soon as practicable thereafter.

\n\n<li>Explicit consent shall be obtained from individuals for the collection, use and disclosure of sensitive personal information,
        unless a law or regulation specifically requires or allows otherwise. A record is maintained of explicit consent
        obtained from individuals.</li>

\n\n<li>Implicit consent shall be considered adequate for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information which does not
    qualify as sensitive personal information.</li>

\n\n<li>Implicit consent shall be considered adequate to share sensitive information between health providers for treatment purposes.
        This allows doctors, nurses, hospitals, laboratory technicians,
        and other health care providers to use or disclose protected health
        information, such as X-rays, laboratory and pathology reports, diagnoses,
        and other medical information for treatment purposes without the patient’s
        authorization. This includes sharing the information to consult with other providers,
        including providers who are not covered entities, to treat a patient,
    or to refer the patient.</li>

\n\n<li>Consent shall be obtained from individuals before their personal information
    is used for purposes not previously identified.</li>

\n\n<li>Appropriate consent shall be obtained from individuals before their personal information is transferred to or from information
        processing systems not owned or controlled by Intelehealth
    except in the cases mentioned above.</li>

        <font color='#EA315B' size='14'><b>\n\nCOLLECTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</b></font>

\nThe collection of personal information shall be limited to the minimum requirement for lawful business purposes

\n\n<ol>Methods of collecting personal information shall be reviewed by management to ensure that personal information is obtained:

       \n\n <li>Fairly, without intimidation or deception, and</li>

    \n\n<li>Lawfully, adhering to laws and regulations relating to the collection of personal information.</li></ol>

       \n\n <li>Individuals shall be notified if additional information is developed or acquired about them.</li>

         <font color='#EA315B' size='14'><b>\n\nLIMITING USE, DISCLOSURE, RETENTION AND DISPOSAL</b></font>

\nPersonal information shall not be used or disclosed for purposes other than those for which it was collected, except
        with the consent of the individual or as permitted by law.

\n\n<li>An information inventory shall be maintained of all personal information collected, its mode of storage, period of
            retention and method of disposal, which is reviewed at least annually.</li>

\n\n<li>Personal information retention shall be only for the duration necessary to fulfil the identified lawful business purposes
            or as prescribed by law.</li>

\n\n<li>Personal information and health records shall be retained for a minimum of 6 years from the date of creation or the date
        the record was last in effect, unless otherwise prescribed by legislative agencies that require records to be retained
            for greater periods of time.</li>

\n\n<ol>Information may be stored in hard copy or electronic copy. The mode of storage will be determined based on the purpose for
        which data is collected and will be reviewed annually.

\n\n<li>Hard copy: physical representations of data, such as paper printouts. This includes, among other things, notes, memos,
    messages, correspondence, transaction records and reports.</li>

\n\n<li>Electronic copy: information stored on electronic media, such as computer hard drives, copier and printer hard drives,
        cloud storage, removable solid drives including memory, disks and
    USB flash drives, mobile phones and magnetic tapes.</li></ol>

\n\n<ol><li>Upon the expiration of identified lawful business purposes, Intelehealth shall either securely erase or anonymize the
            individuals’ personal information.</li></ol>

\n\n<ol><li>When disposing of personal information by completely destroying the hard or electronic copy, including all back ups
            in such a way as to ensure that the information stored on it can never be recovered.</li></ol>

\n\n<ol>Anonymization shall be carried out in such a way that the information cannot be used to identify an individual using
        the “Expert Determination” method. Intelehealth may determine that health information is not individually
        identifiable health information only if:

\n\n<li>A person with appropriate knowledge of and experience with generally accepted statistical and scientific principles
    and methods for rendering information not individually identifiable:</li>

\n\n<li>Applying such principles and methods, determines that the risk is very small that the information could be used,
        alone or in combination with other reasonably available information, by an anticipated recipient to identify
    an individual who is a subject of the information; and</li>

          \n\n<li>Documents the methods and results of the analysis that justify such determination;</li></ol>
<font color='#EA315B' size='14'><b>\n\nFOR REVIEW AND UPDATE</b></font>
\nProcesses shall be established for individuals to:

\n\n<li>Request access to their personal data or information;</li>

        \n\n<li>Correct or update their personal data or information; and</li>

        \n\n<li>Withdraw consent for the collection, use and disclosure of their personal information.</li>

 \n\n<li>The identity of individuals requesting access their personal information shall be reasonably verified before
            providing access to such information.</li>

 \n\n<li>A response shall be given individuals requesting access to their personal information in an accessible form, within a
            defined period from receipt of complaint/ request.</li>

 \n\n<li>Individuals shall be notified, in writing, the reason for any denial of requests for access to personal information.
        This notice will provide the source of Intelehealth’s legal right to deny access and the individual’s right
            to challenge such access as allowed or required by law.</li>

<font color='#EA315B' size='14'><b>\n\nDISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES AND OUTWARD TRANSFERS</b></font>


The disclosure of personal information to third parties shall be only for identified lawful business purposes and with
        appropriate consent from the individuals, unless a law or regulation specifically
        allows or requires otherwise.

\n\n<ol>Management shall ensure that third parties storing or processing personal information on behalf of Intelehealth have:

\n\n<li>Signed agreements to protect personal information consistent with Intelehealth’s Enterprise Privacy Policy and information
    security practices;</li></ol>

\n\nSigned non-disclosure agreements or confidentiality agreements; and

\n\nEstablished procedures to meet the terms of their agreement with Intelehealth to protect personal information

\n\n<ol>Personal information may be transferred outside the jurisdiction in which they were created or stored, for storage or
        processing where any of the following apply:

        \n\n<li>The individual has given consent to the transfer of information</li>

  \n\n<li>The transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the individual and Intelehealth, or the implementation
                of pre-contractual measures taken in response to the individual’s request.</li>>
  \n\n<li>The transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the individual
                between Intelehealth and a third party.</li>

  \n\n<li>The transfer is necessary or legally required on important public interest grounds or for the establishment, exercise or
                defence of legal claims.</li>


            \n\n<li>The transfer is required by law</li>

            \n\n<li>The transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital
                interests of the individual.</li></ol>

 \n\n<li>Remedial action shall be taken in response to misuse or unauthorized disclosure of personal information by a third party
    storing or processing personal information on behalf of Intelehealth.</li>

    <string name="aboutus_text">We are a tech-for-impact organisation : A team of engineers, clinicians, management and public health experts. We\'ve developed an innovative open source telemedicine platform connecting the last mile population. \n\n Mission: We deliver quality healthcare where there is no doctor \n\n Our vision is Health for all. \n\nWe believe in the vision of universal health coverage - that you should be able to receive the health services you need, when and where you need them, without facing financial hardship. We believe in the vision of Universal Health Coverage - that you should be able to receive the health services you need, when and where you need them, without facing any financial hardship (WHO). But realizing this vision requires the collective efforts of an entire ecosystem. We aim to be a catalyst to empower existing health programs to deliver last-mile healthcare through well-designed user-centered telemedicine technology and implementation services. One thing that people don’t understand is that telemedicine is very empowering for women. For a woman living in rural India, health access is a privilege more than a right. Her access to health may be controlled by other people like her husband or in-laws. She has to rely on them for the permission, money, and transportation that she needs to get to a doctor in the nearby city. When I started working on Intelehealth, I was deeply touched by seeing how empowered women felt to be able to walk out of their house to a telemedicine clinic, talk to a doctor and get the care they needed on their own terms. I saw a woman beaten black and blue by her husband, whose in-laws would not give her any money to treat her injuries. The local health worker with the help of a remote doctor was able to assess her injuries, she gave her medicines to manage her pain, ointments to treat the scratches on her body and most important a kind and caring ear to soothe her soul. I met a woman whose husband refused to use any form of birth control and who wanted to speak with a doctor to understand what family planning options she could use. She discussed over teleconsultation various options and ultimately chose an IUD, which the local nurse was able to insert. I resonated deeply with the stories of these women. As a woman who has experienced abuse, I cannot express what it means to have this one thing - the ability to care for your own body - be in your control. I continue to be motivated by the power of telemedicine in creating easily accessible, safe spaces for women to get the care they rightfully deserve. \n\n Neha Verma \nCEO and Co-Founder, Intelehealth</string>
